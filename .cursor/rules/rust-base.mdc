## general organization of the rust code

The rust application is split across different layer:
- lana/ is the application layer. most of the code is in lana/app/src
- core/ contains the key primitives of our banking application that are split around multiple repositories
- lib/ contains some general supporting utilities

we follow Design Driven Development, and hexagonal pattern, for building the architecture of the bank. 

when started, the application expose two servers on 2 different ports: the admin API and the customer API

The admin API is located in lana/admin-server and the custmer API is located in lana/customer-server.
this is where you will find the code for the graphql layer

The server run with Postgres, and is being accessed through the sqlx library.

## verify your work

You should know about those commands:

- `make check-code` to verify that the code compile
- `make sdl` to regenerate the schema.graphql. do not attempt to update schema.graphql yourself
- `make sqlx-prepare` to update the .sqlx files. do not attempt to update the .sqlx files yourself

## general coding rules

- interaction across module boundaries are done through events. public events are listed 
- do not update schema.graphql manually. rather do it with `make sdl`
- we don't want to use openssl. rather we use rust-ssl. import rustls-tls with features flag for package we import

- use Strum library for primitive enum <-> string conversion
- we use DDD (Domaine Driven Design) pattern. the filename give a hint as what it's aim to do: 
-- mod.rs are the interface of the module
-- repo.rs is the interface to the storage layer (most likely postgres)
-- entity.rs contains the events definition, and implementation for their lifecycles

- the dependency graph should be as follow: 
-- core can import lib
-- lana can import core
