This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


### Steps to log in to the admin panel locally:

1. Go to `http://localhost:4455/admin-panel` URL to open the admin panel login.
2. Enter the email. For now, we have two allowed emails: `admin@lava.io` and `user@lava.io`.
3. Open MailHog to get the email magic link: `http://localhost:8025/`.
4. Click on the magic link to log in to the admin panel.
